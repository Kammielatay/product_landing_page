        <p id="start">Have you always wanted to have a house or office space but felt that you didn't have the green thumb everyone talks about? Or maybe you know how to keep plants alive and thriving but don't have the time in your busy schedule to fully devote to shopping for them?</p> <br>

        <p>We all know buying a plant is easy. It is probably the easiest part about planting but if you are anything like me when I first started out, the plant would only last for a few weeks. I would forget to water it or show it love and it would unfortunately die.</p> <br>

        <p>I was determined to keep one plant alive. And that was when The Aesthetically Pleasing Planter came to life.I did the work so that I could help those just like me have plants all around them. It was more than just having a plant though. It was about having planters that aestheticall went with all types of home decor or office spaces.</p> <br>
